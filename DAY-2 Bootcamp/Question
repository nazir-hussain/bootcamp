You can implement these functions with or without using the `prompt()` function for input. The input values can be provided directly as function arguments, taken input as prompt or assigned within the script. Happy coding!



Assignment 1:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as a parameter and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

Assignment 2:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and calculates its factorial using a for loop. The factorial of a number N is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N.

Assignment 3:
Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the larger one.

Assignment 4:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as a parameter and determines whether it's a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Assignment 5:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and prints all the prime numbers less than or equal to that integer. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

Assignment 6:
Write a JavaScript function that simulates a simple calculator. The function should take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /) as parameters and perform the corresponding operation.

Assignment 7:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Assignment 8:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and checks if it's a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.

Assignment 9:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as a parameter and prints the Fibonacci series up to that number. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Assignment 10:
Write a JavaScript function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and prints its multiplication table up to 10.
