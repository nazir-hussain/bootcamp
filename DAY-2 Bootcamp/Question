Complete the following assignments.

Assignment 1: Change Background Color

Title: Change Background Color Assignment

Instructions:
1. Create an HTML document with a title element.
2. Add a heading (e.g., `<h1>Click anywhere on the page to change the background color!</h1>`) to explain the assignment's purpose.
3. Write a JavaScript function called `getRandomColor()` that generates a random color.
4. Write another JavaScript function called `changeBackgroundColor()` that sets the background color of the document's body to the random color obtained from `getRandomColor()`.
5. Add an onclick event to the entire document that calls the `changeBackgroundColor()` function whenever the user clicks anywhere on the page.
6. Test the assignment by opening the HTML document in a web browser. Verify that clicking anywhere on the page changes the background color.

Assignment 2: display names

const names = [ "Aarav", "Sanya", "Vikram", "Neha", "Rohan", "Priya", "Amit", "Meera", "Rajiv", "Ananya" ];

You have been provided with an array of 10 Indian names. 
Your task is to create a simple web page featuring two buttons: "Next" and "Previous". 
Using these buttons, display the names sequentially, one at a time. 

Here's how to proceed: Array of Indian Names: Use the given array containing 10 Indian names to start the assignment. 

Button Setup: Design an HTML page with a space to display the names and include the "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation. 

Initial Display: Upon loading the page, show the first name from the array. 

Next Button Functionality: When the "Next" button is clicked, display the next name in the array. If you reach the end of the array, wrap around to the beginning. 

Previous Button Functionality: Clicking the "Previous" button should show the previous name in the array. If you're at the beginning, loop back to the end of the array.
